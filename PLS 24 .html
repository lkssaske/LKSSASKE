Not only the club and team logos are always in a mess in the PLS game but also the team name. We get teams like Arsenal get to be called the London reds and other teams with names related from where each team originated from.

This makes it easy to even trace different teams from different leagues and play them with ease.
  <h2>EXTRA LEAGUES</h2>
  Talking about league, the most enticing part of the game is when a player can get to play the game with their favourite player like Ronaldo and Messi. But this makes it impossible for the Pro League soccer game since it gets to have limited league to be played. But from more research work this is made possible by different game mod makers and design makers. With the mod version of PLS, there are advanced league mods added together with their respective league logos that makes them easy to be noticed and choose. From different game leagues like the Saudi Arabian pro league, MLS , Premier league, Spanish leagues, bundesliga, la liga, seria A, league 1 and others popular and more leagues available in different countries. With this It makes it possible for for gamers to play with their favourite players who are not available in top leagues like Ronaldo and Messi.
