  <h1 class="centered-title">FIELD TACTICS</h1>
    
    <p>Getting trophies and titles and also going upto more than 15 games undefeated is what all gamers desire to achieve in FCM 24 game. It would be shameful if I gave you tactics then fail to achieve them and that's why I will leave arsenal for Scotland. But anyway in this video will show you the full game tactics from formation to field and finances and performance. 
Without wasting a lot of time lets start. Among the best top teams to start your career in FCM 24 and attain an maintain performance is as shown. Don't go out signing with other teams, you will only get messed up. Always start your career from the smallest team to gain reputation and qualifications. Let's talk about field tactics.To begin with the worst tactic you can ever set up for your team is the shooting tactic. Most of the teams would prefer using the when possible shooting tactic. But  how does this impact and affect your team performance ? Players will always be shooting ball whenever they feel like not knowing if it's going on target or not , they will not be perfect at taking their chances towards goal scoring. The main point about the shooting is not bad in fact depending on the players you have and your team status, this tactic is suitable for small teams to try and grab goals and win the game. For us we use the patient shooting strategy since we have good forward players who would take chances in a better way than shooting like cowards.The balanced shot strategy is also recommended and you can also switch to it when the game is not going as planned or when the team is in crucial state during a match. Let's move on to the final third strategy, with little to say in this we use the patient tactic since we already have a dream team. But doing a cross early or balance in the final third doesn't give out to a big impact. This will always depend on your midfielders abilities and coordinations with the strikers. I would prefer you sign players who have a good coordination In playing style together with the manager. Exploiting your opponent should always be in both sides balancing your team strength is a key for this strategy. If you have very strong and skillful players of your left formation you can switch it to left and exploit the game with you best players. But if your squad is balanced the better for you. The playing style is non the Less always within your preference and the players preference, if you sign players who prefer the passing style you can freely use it together with the assistant managers and the main managers who should have the same playing style for the good coordination. Moving on to the in possession we use attacking since you can't win a game if you don't score so we would take the players to full attack strategy, this also depends on the strikers you have for your squad, you can also use the balanced but cautious Will only mess you up, so don't use it. Finally the defending strategy, most of the managers will always prefer deep defending but this will always give the opponent midfielders and strikers to exploit you more centrally and into your box. But why should we do this when we have the best defensive and goalkeeper, And without hesitation we used the press high defensive strategy for our team. With this strategy we made a huge breakthrough against a lot of teams and a very huge proces for the teams hard work. We won the Premier league, the champions league and the FA cup within one season.</p>

  <h1 class="centered-title">FINANCE TACTICS</h1>  
      <P1>The next thing is about your finances and how you manage them.This tactics may apply to both the wealthy and the average teams based on their development. Without wasting much time lets get started. What really affects your finances and how to avoid and fix them for a better finance management.To begin with the biggest expense rate is the players and staff wedges. Overpaying Staff members and players will always land you in trouble. The board alway provide you with the recommended wedges to offer players and staffs with when renewing or signing new recruitment. Always offer the provided amount and go up the offer with minimal added cash and not offer up to the agent's amount. If it's rejected and the provided amount is still way too high, just pull out the deal and get another recruitment, but if Incase you are dealing with key player or staff member with a global rank and very important you can go for the deal for better and maintained performance. So how do we avoid this salary drain issues from the staff and players? The best strategy is to sign in highly rated and recommend free agents with high and average ratings and age. It's easier to sign free agent players and staff with a benefit of paying them little but within the requested amount from their agent, you can also go below the amount and the offers will also be accepted. Alternatively you can promote young players from the academy to the main team And avoid a lot of expenses. You can sign as man of the academy players as you want. This leads to an advantage of lots of players marketing and revenue. Taking young and academy players out to loan offers also reduces the wedges and advantages of them picking up ranks for market advantages. It's not necessary to take all of them to loan some of them can be very useful for the squad. The next revenue management strategy leads to the stadium, among the best earning for the club. Make sure you upgrade your stadium for better attendance and capacity for more income, every time you make a stadium upgrade don't hesitate to increase your ticket prices. This will greatly boost your earnings and profits. Without much words, what's the point of having a big stadium without fans? Once your capacity is increased you can also proceed to increase your fanbse by doing campaigns which will increase your stadium attendance leading to more tickets sale . holding upto 120 thousand stadium capacity is among the most expensive stadium in the league and having upto 5 million fanbase as well. The next step is improving your facilities for better estimated revenue per head which will be added to the bank. Improving this is also important but also need alot of money to do so. Next strategy is the sponsors , we all know sponsors play a very good part in revenue profits. Signing as many sponsor offers as possible is also a good strategy to do which will lead up to additional provided funds for your team. But you can also earn more from sponsors than you know. Giving sponsors advanced advantages like naming the the stadium for a period of time can add up to a very huge amount of money. Sponsors can pay upto 180 million just to change the stadium name for a period of time. Among the best we talk about your financial manager, getting a good financial manger with good reputation. This Will avoid maximisation of your funds. The most important thing to check up on is your financial play status, you can regularly check it to know how your finances are doing. Your financial health should also range within very good and good at least. Finally talking about raising finances and talking bank loans. Most of the managers always mess up when they do this, but for a  chairman like me will only get loan request which i must pay in return. Doing finance raising for managers should always be done once or at most twice in a season only if your club is really running low and in the worst financial play and status. If you do a lot of this as a manager you will end up in the sacking news papers and books and start all over in other team. I may have forgotten but selling or releasing surplus players in the squad also helps in fair financial play to avoid paying players who are not used in the squad. Having explained to the max the financial strategy and tactics for the fcm 24 game is I believe you can now try out and see the performance on your side. The most important thing to Note is that you cannot do all of this at once, take your time and proceed with each step slowly as you proceed. If you try to achieve all you'll end up being sacked . I believe I've explained to the maximum all you need to do and try out.</P1>

  <h1 class="centered-title">YOUNG STARS</h1>
      <p1>Let's talk about young stars and youths . Getting young players for your squad is always good tactic towards your team success.we are looking at the best tactics for getting young stars for your team. Without wasting much time lets get started. The easiest and fastest way to get young Stars is within your own facility. The academy players are best and not to mention free young stars available for your to sing them. Not to forget you can only sign academy players of at least 17 years of age. Always check at the overall ratings before considering the players promotions. Once you've done the promotion to academy players. You can go directly to the players profile. From this, you can request the players future potential performance and overall ratings. Remember not all players are destined to be good, if the potential report shows the player is to rate below 80, you can consider replacing or giving loan offers, on the other hand if it shows a rate of up to 95 then that's a very good player to keep. The next tip is searching for the young stars. Searching for young Stars is also a good tactic in getting quality players, so just head over to the players search option. For this you have to filter the players age to under 18, once done you can also filter the players contract status to free agents. From this you will get a lot of good players for free , but before signing a kid you must not forget to run some repost on them and also the potential rating on them. This will also help you to avoid signing jokers to your squad. Another quality trick which is the best is just similar to this, filter age to under 18 but this time the contract option is set to under contract. Players below 18 and already under contract are always the best and future youngsters available. To finalise this , you can't be a good student without a good teacher, when a player is potentially set to a certain rating he will only achieve this if there are good coaches and players around them. So what am actually saying is that your under 23 manager should be good with at least 80 ratings, a manager rating 70 can't make someone who is already rating better than him to be better. You can also reduce your work by getting a good scout to help you find good young players. You can also set the type of players you are looking for and the scout will search for them. With that I believe I'm done with young players tactics and how to find good ones.</p1>

  <h1 class="centered-title">NEW SEASON</h1>
      <p1>Let's talk about what you should do when starting a new season on starting your career. Starting a new season may always seem easy but not as it sounds. Here are some tips for starting a new season in fcm 24. The first thing to always do is check on the contract conditions for your players and staff. From Here you can then renew contracts,release or sell players for your next project. Another thing to do is raising you ticket prices. If your team performance was improved from the previous season you can consider doing so. Don't increase your pricing if your performance has been very bad . Next thing is Signing sponsor deals which will also boost you up in terms of financial support. We usually sing a lot of contracts and also give up to the naming rights sponsor deals as well. Always boost up you fans by doing campaigns to gain more fans  who intern attend towards the stadium matches and bring more finance. Talking about that you can also sack and sign more staff members if you think the current ones are not good enough. Don't also forget to increase your monthly salary to increase your coins earnings which can help you with the game progress. Remember when doing this not to over exceed the overdraft limit provided. Recruitment of young players is always necessary who inturn can also be useful in the first squad team. And this is how to start a season in fcm 24. Always limit overspending money and the results will always pay off.

With that I believe I have exhausted all you need to know and try in the FCM 24 game. Some tactics may be missing but are always covered up in separate and different videos so don't forget to subscribe and watch other videos not to miss out on more tactics.</p1>
