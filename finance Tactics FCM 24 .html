  Everyone sometimes have to face a bad financial state when managing a team in FCM 24. Today i am making full tactics which may apply to both the wealthy and the average teams about financial management in FCM 24. Without wasting much time lets get started. What are some of the things that affect your finances and how to avoid and fix them for a better finance state and health.To begin with the biggest expense rate is about the players and staff salaries and wedges. Overpaying them will always land you in a very bad financial condition. The board will always provide you with the recommended wedge to offer any player or staff when renewing or recruiting a new member. Always offer the provided amount and only go up the offer with minimal added cash and not offer up to the agent's amount. If the agent rejects and they still want a huge amount of money, just pull out the deal and look forward another recruitment. So how do we avoid this salary drain issues from the staff and players? The best strategy is to sign the high rating free agents. It's always easy to sign free agent players and staff members because of the advantage of paying them little and also no purchase cash needed. Alternatively you can also promote young players from the academy to the main team. You can sign as many of the academy players as you want. This will always lead to an advantage of the young potential players marketing. Taking the academy players out to loans also reduces the wedges and advantages of them picking up ranks and recognition for market advantages and in turn benefit from purchase. It's not necessary to take all of them to loan some of them can be very useful for the squad. The next revenue strategy leads to the stadium, this is among the best earning site for the club. Make sure you upgrade your stadium for better attendance and capacity for more income, remember every time you make a stadium upgrade never hesitate to increase your ticket prices. This will greatly boost your earnings and profits. Without much words, we all know it's pointless having a huge stadium without fans. Once your capacity is increased you can then proceed to increase your fanbse by doing campaigns which will increase your fans therefore a huge stadium attendance leading to more tickets sale .  The next step is improving your facilities for better estimated revenue per head which is added to the bank account. Improving this is also important but also needs alot of money. Next strategy is about the sponsors, we all know sponsors play a very good role in revenue and profits. Signing as many sponsor deals as possible is also a good strategy to do which will add good funds for your team management. Did you know that you can also earn more from sponsors than you know? Giving sponsors advanced advantages like naming of the stadium for a period of time can add up to a very huge amount of money. Sponsors can pay up to 180 million just to change the stadium name for a period of time. Among the best we talk about your financial manager, get a good financial manger with good overall rating. This Will avoid maximisation of your funds and improve your loss. Finally talking about raising finances and taking bank loans. Most of the managers always mess up and get in trouble when they over do this. Doing finance raising for managers should always be done once in a season only if your club is really running low and in the worst financial play and status. If you do a lot of this as a manager you will only end up getting sacked and start all over in other team. I may have forgotten but selling or releasing surplus players in the squad also helps in fair financial play to avoid paying players who are not used in the squad. Having explained to the max the financial strategy and tactics for the fcm 24 game is I believe you can now try out and see the performance on your side. The most important thing to Note is that you cannot do all of this at once, take your time and proceed with each step slowly as you proceed in the game. If you try to achieve all of this at once, you'll end up being sacked . I believe I've explained to the maximum all you need to do and try out.
